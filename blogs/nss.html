                                In 2022, after completing my degree in Computer
                                Science and Technology in China, I returned to
                                Ghana to begin my national service ‚Äî the
                                mandatory one-year program for graduates. Before
                                continuing with my master's, I saw this as a
                                chance to give back and maybe even gain some
                                hands-on experience.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                I was posted to the Ghana Armed Forces,
                                specifically to an office known as <em>49</em>,
                                with the role of IT technician. On paper, it
                                sounded like a solid opportunity. I was excited.
                                I imagined working in a structured, possibly
                                high-tech environment where I could apply my
                                skills and learn something new. But the reality
                                was far more complicated.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                It all started with a one-week seminar that was
                                meant to prepare us for our postings.
                                Unfortunately, it didn't do much. It felt like a
                                checkbox exercise ‚Äî long and mostly disconnected
                                from the work we'd soon be doing (or not doing).
                                When I finally reported to 49, things were
                                quiet. For the first two weeks, there was
                                nothing set up for us. No computers, no
                                structured tasks, no onboarding, no guidance. We
                                were simply... there. Waiting.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Eventually, tasks came ‚Äî but not the kind I
                                expected as an IT technician. We were routinely
                                sent to buy food: breakfast early in the day,
                                and lunch around noon. The vendors were about a
                                40-minute walk from the office, meaning we spent
                                nearly two hours every day doing food runs.
                                Refusing wasn't really an option ‚Äî when we
                                pushed back, we were asked to do push-ups or jog
                                laps as a form of "discipline."
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                It was discouraging. The gap between what I
                                hoped to learn and what I was doing felt
                                enormous. Official work hours were 8:00 AM to
                                2:30 PM, but most of the soldiers came in late,
                                sent us on errands, and left us feeling more
                                like personal assistants than young
                                professionals in training.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                That said, not everyone treated us that way.
                                There were some civilians at the office who
                                stood out. They were respectful, welcoming, and
                                tried to explain how the Armed Forces
                                functioned. While they couldn't teach us much in
                                terms of IT, they offered something else
                                valuable: a sense of dignity. I made genuine
                                friendships there ‚Äî one in particular that's
                                lasted well beyond service. I still stay in
                                touch with a colleague who offers me guidance
                                and life advice even now.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                And there was one soldier ‚Äî a sergeant ‚Äî who
                                made a real difference. He noticed how the other
                                soldiers were treating us and quietly stepped
                                in. He often took me along on his own errands,
                                just to get me away from the office and out of
                                the cycle of errands and punishments. It might
                                have seemed small, but it meant a lot. It was a
                                reminder that even in difficult situations,
                                there are always people who choose to act with
                                kindness and integrity.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Eventually, I completed my service and moved to
                                Italy to begin my master's program at the Free
                                University of Bolzano. Looking back, the year
                                didn't give me the technical experience I'd
                                hoped for. But it gave me something else ‚Äî
                                perspective. I learned how to manage
                                frustration, how to maintain my sense of self in
                                uncomfortable situations, and how to spot the
                                good in people even when it's not immediately
                                obvious.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                National service wasn't what I expected, but it
                                added something real to my story ‚Äî not a line on
                                my CV, but a lived chapter. And in the end, that
                                counts too.
