                    <p>
                        I have a habit that puzzles some of my colleagues: I build things from scratch that already exist. I've written a raytracer when Blender exists. I've implemented a TCP server when countless libraries do this better. I've built a hash map when every language has one built in.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        This isn't about reinventing wheels or NIH syndrome. It's about understanding how the wheels work—and knowing when to use the existing ones.
                    </p>

                    <h2>The Knowing Gap</h2>

                    <p>
                        There's a difference between <em>using</em> something and <em>understanding</em> it. I can use a hash map perfectly well without knowing how it works. I can call <code>map.get(key)</code> all day. But until I implement one myself, I don't really <em>know</em> hash maps.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Why does load factor matter? What happens during a resize? Why do some operations take O(n) in the worst case? Why might I choose a tree-based map over a hash-based one? These questions only make sense after you've hit the walls yourself.
                    </p>

                    <blockquote>
                        "What I cannot create, I do not understand." — Richard Feynman
                    </blockquote>

                    <p>
                        This isn't gatekeeping. Plenty of excellent developers use tools without understanding their internals, and that's fine. But for me, deep understanding leads to better decisions. When I know how the pieces work, I can predict behavior, debug faster, and choose the right tool for the job.
                    </p>

                    <h2>The Raytracer</h2>

                    <p>
                        Last year, I built a software raytracer from scratch. No graphics libraries, no shaders—just math and pixels. It renders spheres, handles reflections, and produces surprisingly pretty images for something that takes minutes to render a single frame.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Was this practical? Not at all. Blender renders better images in milliseconds. But building that raytracer taught me:
                    </p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>How light actually works (or how we approximate it)</li>
                        <li>Why ray-object intersection is the bottleneck</li>
                        <li>Why spatial data structures like BVH exist</li>
                        <li>Why GPUs are so much faster at this</li>
                        <li>The difference between physically-based and Phong shading</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>
                        Now when I read about RTX ray tracing or look at rendering in game engines, I understand the fundamentals. I can read papers about global illumination and follow along. That knowledge compounds.
                    </p>

                    <h2>The TCP Server</h2>

                    <p>
                        My TCP server project started as "let's see how hard this is" and ended up teaching me more about networking than any course.
                    </p>

<pre><code>// What I thought networking was
socket.connect(host, port);
socket.send(data);

// What networking actually involves
// - Socket creation and binding
// - Non-blocking I/O or thread pools
// - Connection state machines
// - Buffer management
// - Graceful shutdown
// - Timeout handling
// - Keep-alive management
// - Error recovery
// ...</code></pre>

                    <p>
                        Before building this, I used HTTP libraries and network frameworks without thinking. After building it, I understand <em>why</em> those abstractions exist and what trade-offs they make. When something goes wrong at the network layer, I have a mental model to debug with.
                    </p>

                    <h2>When To Build From Scratch</h2>

                    <p>
                        Not everything is worth building from scratch. I'm not writing my own operating system or compiler (yet). The decision depends on a few factors:
                    </p>

                    <h3>1. Is this foundational to my work?</h3>

                    <p>
                        I build things that are fundamental to domains I work in. As someone working with distributed systems, understanding networking, concurrency, and data structures at a deep level pays dividends. I probably don't need to write my own text editor.
                    </p>

                    <h3>2. Is the knowledge transferable?</h3>

                    <p>
                        Building a raytracer taught me linear algebra, spatial data structures, and optimization techniques that apply far beyond graphics. Building a custom CMS for my blog probably wouldn't transfer as well.
                    </p>

                    <h3>3. Can I scope it reasonably?</h3>

                    <p>
                        A hash map takes a weekend. A database engine takes years. I pick projects I can complete in weeks, not months. Unfinished projects teach less than finished ones.
                    </p>

                    <h2>When To Use Existing Solutions</h2>

                    <p>
                        At work, I almost always use existing solutions. The TCP server I built? It's a learning project, not a production system. In production, I use battle-tested libraries with years of bug fixes and security patches.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The goal isn't to replace existing tools—it's to understand them well enough to use them effectively.
                    </p>

                    <div class="note">
                        <p>
                            <strong>The paradox:</strong> The better I understand how something works, the more comfortable I am using someone else's implementation. I can evaluate trade-offs, read the source when needed, and contribute fixes.
                        </p>
                    </div>

                    <h2>The Learning Curriculum</h2>

                    <p>
                        I think of these projects as a self-directed curriculum. Each one fills in a piece of the puzzle:
                    </p>

                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Hash map</strong> → hashing, collisions, memory layout</li>
                        <li><strong>Raytracer</strong> → linear algebra, rendering pipeline, optimization</li>
                        <li><strong>TCP server</strong> → sockets, protocols, I/O models</li>
                        <li><strong>Memory allocator</strong> → how malloc works, fragmentation</li>
                        <li><strong>Interpreter</strong> → parsing, ASTs, evaluation</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>
                        Each project builds on previous knowledge. The memory allocator was easier after understanding how hash maps manage buckets. The interpreter was easier after implementing the expression parser for my calculator.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Beyond Code</h2>

                    <p>
                        This philosophy extends beyond programming. I read technical papers, not just blog post summaries. I study the internals of databases I use, not just their query language. When I use a framework, I eventually read its source.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        It's slower. There's always more to learn than time allows. But the understanding compounds. Each piece of deep knowledge makes learning the next thing easier.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Practical Advice</h2>

                    <p>
                        If this resonates with you, here's how I approach these projects:
                    </p>

                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Start small.</strong> Implement a basic version first. Add features incrementally.</li>
                        <li><strong>Use resources wisely.</strong> Read one good reference, not ten. "Crafting Interpreters" for interpreters. "Ray Tracing in One Weekend" for raytracers.</li>
                        <li><strong>Set scope limits.</strong> Define "done" before you start. A raytracer that renders spheres is done. Adding every feature in Blender is not the goal.</li>
                        <li><strong>Write about it.</strong> Explaining what you learned solidifies understanding. Even notes to yourself help.</li>
                        <li><strong>Keep the code.</strong> Your implementation is a reference you can return to. I regularly look back at old projects.</li>
                    </ol>

                    <h2>The Point</h2>

                    <p>
                        I build things from scratch not to replace existing tools, but to understand them. That understanding makes me a better engineer—able to debug deeper, choose better, and learn faster.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        It's not about the code. The raytracer sits unused. The TCP server never handled real traffic. But the knowledge they represent? That I use every day.
                    </p>
